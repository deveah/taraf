Taraf - a small backing track generator

Taraf is a small backing track generator, which uses 'styles' as input. You can
think of 'styles' as of musical templates, except for the fact that 'styles'
also have default behaviour. Right now there's nothing much to see, since the
project is in its early stages of development.

Taraf is using FluidSynth for rendering the sound, and Lua for data and MIDI
processing.
