Taraf - a small backing track generator

Taraf is a small backing track generator, which uses 'styles' as input. You can
think of 'styles' as of musical templates, except for the fact that 'styles'
also have default behaviour.

Taraf is using FluidSynth for rendering the sound, and Lua for data and MIDI
processing.
